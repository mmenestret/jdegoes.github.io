On January 13th, Balaji Srinivasan&mdash;a successful entrepreneur, a board
partner at Andreesson Horowitz, and the current CEO of [21.co](http://21.co)&mdash;
mysteriously and unexpectedly deleted all of his tweets.

In their place, he posted a [single tweet](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/820139852041777152)
to his 50,000 followers:

> Don't argue on Twitter.
>
> Build the future.

Mr. Srinivasan is well-respected in Silicon Valley.

He's smart, knowledgable, accomplished, and possesses a keen ability to see
through bullshit. Yet Balaji retains an unspoiled passion for improving the human
condition through science and technology&mdash;a obvious theme of his [earlier
startup](https://www.counsyl.com) in the health care space.

Personally, since Balaji stumbled onto my own timeline, I've learned much from
his tweets on technology, politics, and society.

When Balaji quit Twitter, it was a shock to me and countless others. Speculation
abounded, but all discussions seemed to center on a rumor that Balaji was being
[considered by Trump to head up the FDA](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-13/trump-said-to-consider-another-thiel-associate-to-lead-fda).

Gizmodo [speculated](http://gizmodo.com/why-did-trumps-top-fda-pick-delete-all-his-tweets-1791227569)
that Mr. Srinivasan deleted his tweets because he had previously posted
unflattering tweets about Trump. Recode, [in much harsher words](http://www.recode.net/2017/1/14/14276530/balaji-srinivasan-trump-fda-twitter-andreessen-horowitz), argued that Balaji's outspoken criticism of the FDA was to blame.

Personally, I have a different theory about why Balaji quit Twitter: he quit
because [Twitter's fucked](/articles/fuck-twitter).

The medium is custom-designed to signal virtue and vice. If you aren't into
either of those, then you can share links and cute cat pics, but that's about it.

In particular, if your goal is to inform and persuade, to use reason and data to
bring about the change you want to see in the world, then [long-form](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOubCHLXT6A) beats the
living shit out of short-form.

In what may be Balaji's smartest move to date, he's basically said he's done
trying to change the world 140 characters at a time (a strategy that can never
work). Instead, he's going to build the future with his own two hands.

People can talk trash to you on Twitter all day long, but it's impossible to
argue with the enormous power of actual change. The real mystery is not why
Balaji quit Twitter, but why more people *haven't*.

Keep an eye on Mr. Srinivasan. While he's gone from Twitter, my guess is that
the impact he will have on the world is just getting started.
