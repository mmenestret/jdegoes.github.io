#### LambdaConf will focus on professional ethics instead of morality.

Individuals each act according to their own morality, but we must share a common set of professional ethics in order to interact with one another in a professional setting.

For LambdaConf, there is no direct moral component: there is only the determination of which professional ethics best facilitate the goals of the conference. For this, we have come up with a code of conduct, which we will improve over time.

The distinction is [explained elsewhere](http://www.diffen.com/difference/Ethics_vs_Morals):

> "A lawyer's morals may tell her that murder is reprehensible and that murderers should be punished, but her ethics as a professional lawyer, require her to defend her client to the best of her abilities, even if she knows that the client is guilty."

#### LambdaConf is more committed than ever to a welcoming environment.

LambdaConf is more committed than ever to providing a physically and verbally safe environment. Toward that end, we *will* pass safety and trust judgments on attendees, and hold attendees to a strict code of professionalism.

Everyone who attends the conference is required to treat all other attendees with respect, dignity, and empathy; to communicate non-violently with honest self-expression; and to refrain from stereotyping, belittling, bullying, and harassing attendees.

We have absolutely zero tolerance for any behaviors or materials at the conference that are sexist, racist, ageist, sizeist, homophobic, transphobic, or otherwise discriminatory.

Enforcing professional behavior at the conference is not enough for some people. We do understand this, but every individual has a choice whether or not to attend.

#### LambdaConf isn't going to become political.

Our act of refusing to ban someone for their political views has taken on a life of its own, as people have tried to turn this decision into a political battle for the ages.

Free speech advocates have gathered on one side, advocates for social justice on the other, and plenty of unkind people have aligned themselves with one of these sides for their own personal or political reasons.

We have no desire to be involved in this fight, nor to see others hurt by it. It's not our war.

We did not start a conference on functional programming to become embroiled in politics. We just want to run a great conference on functional programming.

#### LambdaConf isn't going to be swayed by social media.

Our recent personal experience on social media (in which we were harassed, insulted, and vilified) has taught us an important lesson: social media is fickle, highly emotional, and irrational; and it distorts or ignores the truth in exchange for more likes and retweets.

After much reflection, we have decided that we will adopt a policy that prevents us from making policy changes solely in response to social media, with a mandatory cool-off period.

For people who want to contribute, there are still plenty of ways to help. Join one of our committees, participate in calls for feedback, or write to us. We ask that you be kind, and use science, data, and thoughtful arguments that avoid logical fallacies.

#### LambdaConf is going to accept donations from everyone.

If you have the luxury of having so much money you can't find a good cause for more, then we envy you, but we don't share your problem, and neither does LambdaConf.

Money is money, and donations pay for scholarships, speaker accommodations, travel assistance, many one-off discounts that we have issued since year one, and much more.

If you want to help us figure out who we should provide *marketing services* to, then please write us with your thoughts on the matter (tweets don’t count, as per the above).

#### LambdaConf isn't going to adopt xyist policies.

The view that only straight white males have the emotional resiliency to occupy the same building as someone with offensive views is inherently *xyist* (see the appendix). We know women, people of color, and others who are offended by this view.

There are people of *all* genders, colors, ages, sizes, sexual-orientations, and every other demographic who may be too emotionally threatened to occupy the same building as others with offensive views.

The fear cuts across *every* demographic. We recognize this fact, we empathize deeply, but we also understand that any choice will alienate some people from all demographics, and we have decided to draw our line at professional ethics.

#### LambdaConf's talk selection process will change next year.

We don't want to give away a slot for a presentation if literally no one's going to come to see it, even if the functional programming content is a great fit for LambdaConf. It's just wasteful, and we want to avoid waste.

We haven't made any decisions yet, and we'll solicit community input later this year. So far, the best idea is to conduct a blind proposal review by a technical committee, followed by an independent speaker review by early registered attendees (or even a separate committee).

The speaker feedback would let us know if people would see a talk from a given speaker: either regardless of content, only if the content was interesting, or under no circumstances at all (even if the content was amazing).

From here, it's a matter of math to figure out how to weight the two, based on the biasing effects of the weighting process. LambdaConf has always been a conference that favors first-time and lesser-known speakers, and we want to keep it that way.

To be clear, this would not constitute a moral judgment on potential speakers and would not in any way interfere with someone attending LambdaConf, giving a hallway talk, or speaking at the unconference. It would just help us ensure that we don't end up with three tracks booked with awesome functional programming content that no one is interested in attending.

#### LambdaConf will continue being a force for positive change.

Everyone who has been to LambdaConf knows what it's about. It has changed many people's lives, and given many people much-needed jobs. It's created a warm, welcoming, and tolerant environment where people can learn from and share the latest advances in software engineering.

We're going to keep doing all this and more.

As of last week, the organization is officially a non-profit, dedicated to the continuous technical education of all peaceful people.

We're going to redouble our efforts to introduce people from outside tech into the community and help them find jobs at supportive companies.

And we're going to do it with the same kindness, compassion, and love that the conference has become known for.

# Appendix

## Types of Exclusion

![External Versus Internal Exclusion](/images/internal-external-exclusion.png)

There is a qualitative distinction between a *conference* deciding you can't attend, and *you* deciding that you can't attend.

By choosing to host a conference in Colorado, we are probably making it less likely that people from Japan will attend. We are not, however, *excluding* people from Japan. Rather, we are making a choice that makes it more likely that people from Japan will *exclude themselves* because of the cost and inconvenience of the trip.

LambdaConf is very *inclusive*. This choice, along with many others that we make, make it both more and less likely that different people will exclude themselves from the conference.

## Social Versus Professional

![Social Versus Professional](/images/social-versus-professional.png)

We all have different levels of emotional comfort for different individuals. We'll tell some people our most intimate secrets. We don't even want to be in the same building with others.

We think it's useful to divide these levels of comfort into social (the stuff we do for personal enjoyment) and professional (the stuff we do to earn a living).

Our social lives give us the freedom to engage with whoever we want, for whatever reasons we want.

Our professional lives, on the other hand, often demand (or benefit from) a certain ability to engage in professional activities with other professionals, even if we would never socialize with them on a personal level, and even if we find their personal views offensive.

## Assault

![Types of Assault](/images/types-of-assault.png)

Some people will feel emotionally threatened in the presence of others with offensive views, even if those people are behaving well.

This fact is very compelling for all of us, but we have realized something else: emotional assault is qualitatively different from both physical and verbal assault.

Physical and verbal assault can be measured and compared, and therefore regulated (not without some difficulty, of course). But emotional assault cannot be measured or compared, therefore it is not possible to regulate it in any principled way.

If a conference gets into the business of banning people based on their predicted probability of causing emotional distress for expected attendees, then it's going to have to make some very subjective calls.

 * Someone with progressive political views might feel emotionally threatened in the presence of rabid and well-known Trump supporters who are openly contemptuous of progressives in their personal lives.
 * People who are openly gay may feel emotionally threatened in the presence of fundamentalist Christians (let’s not forget the Bible says, "If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.").
 * A devout Muslim might feel emotionally threatened in the presence of an atheist who (like some notable atheists) publicly claims to be morally and intellectually superior to theists.

What is the depth of emotional assault in all these cases? How do you compare them? How do you decide who to allow into your space, and who to ban?

If you go down this path, you have to make subjective judgment calls about whose pain is greater or more important to you. Some conferences can and should do this, but we wish to keep our conference focused on functional programming (with a strong and well-enforced professional code of ethics).

## Xyism

![Xyism](/images/xyism.png)

Define a group by a predicate. If you make any statement about the group that isn't *tautologically* equivalent to the predicate, then you're engaging in what we call *xyism* (*zee-ism*).

For example, let's say you define a group containing all people who shave their heads. If you make a statement that, because Bob shaves his head, he must be unkind, then because "unkind" is not another word for "people who shave their heads", you are engaging in *xyism*.

Xyism isn't just irrational, illogical, and incoherent — it's often offensive.

## Different Tactics

![Different Tactics to Achieve the Same Goal](/images/tactics-for-a-goal.png)

We want our species to find a way to coexist peacefully in a world of abundant diversity.

We think this is more and more important as technology makes it easier for us to destroy each other (how soon before you can desktop-print a virus that will target and kill a specific individual? Or even a drone that does the same?).

We think many people share this goal, even if they don't always agree on how to get there.

As a simple matter of self-interest, treating all your opponents like an undifferentiated mass who are all equally wrong-thinking creates common cause among them, from the "purest evil" all the way down to the the ones who hold only minor differences of opinion and who would much rather be allied with you.

There is a strategy called "divide and conquer": it has a name because it is effective. The opposite strategy — where you unite all your opponents so as to maximize their number and effectiveness — doesn't have a name.
